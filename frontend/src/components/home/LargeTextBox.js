        <p className="paragraph">By this point the route has joined the Cape Wrath Trail - a more demanding route for backpackers.
        The rewards increase too, with the glories of the dramatic West Highlands - the Falls of Glomach,
        the wilds of Monar and the Great Wilderness of Letterewe beyond Kinlochewe.
        The route crosses wild country to Oykel Bridge and then northwards to Inchnadamph and into Sutherland.
        A final wild stretch leads through this lonely land, passing the iconic beach of Sandwood Bay en route to Cape Wrath - and journey's end.</p>
